koken-contact
=============

This is a contact form for the CMS Koken!

First you must chang the contact.lens to inlude the proper include's for you're theme.
For example
```html
<koken:include file="layouts/header.html" />
<koken:include file="layouts/footer.html" />
```
==============

The best way to know what to type in place of the include's is to look at one of you're other lens files and copy the includes from one of them into this contact.lens.

==============
<h2>Where to put the files</h2>
You must put your files in the theme file on your koken install on your server!
An example is /koken/storage/themes/nameoftheme.
<p>Your contact.lens must be in the same place the rest of the theams are.</p>
<p>Just put the contact folder in the same place.</p>
