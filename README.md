koken-contact
=============

This is a contact form for the CMS Koken!

First you must chang the contact.lens to inlude the proper include's for you're theme.
For example
```html
<koken:include file="layouts/header.html" />
<koken:include file="layouts/footer.html" />
```
==============

The best way to know what to type in place of the include's is to look at one of you're other lens files and copy the includes from one of them into this contact.lens.

==============
<h2>Where to put the files</h2>
You must put your files in the theme file on your koken install on your server!
An example is /koken/storage/themes/nameoftheme.
<p>You must put the contact.lens and contact folder in the theme folder</p>
